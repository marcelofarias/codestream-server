The mongo library provides a mongo client wrapper for the node mongo driver (mongo_client.js). It also provides the
MongoCollection class (mongo_collection.js), which bridges the abstract DataCollection class to the mongo client.
Only a limited set of what the mongo driver provides is supported in the MongoCollection class, but this can be
expanded as needs arise.
